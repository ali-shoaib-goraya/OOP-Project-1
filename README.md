# Console Based Facebook

## Description:
This project is a part of my second-semester OOP Course. It's a console-based social media platform similar to Facebook, implemented in Python. The data storage is handled using the Openpyxl library, which allows data to be stored in an Excel file. The design of the project follows the principles of object-oriented programming.

## Environment Setup:
Ensure you have Python installed on your device along with the required libraries like Openpyxl.

## How to Run:
1. Download the "Console_based_facebook.py" and "Facebook.xlsx" files from GitHub.
2. Place both files in the same folder for ease of access.
3. Run the "Console_based_facebook.py" file.
4. Follow the prompts to interact with the application.

## Guidelines for Exploration:
- Make decisions based on your choice to explore the functionality.
- To fully test the functionality, create at least two accounts.
- One account can send messages, send requests after logging in, then logout.
- Use the other account to see the messages, requests, and more functionality.
